Description:
  EarthMan is a game created to generate environmental awareness in the next generation. Environment is one of the key aspects to a sustainable future and it only makes sense to take it up as seriously as possible. EarthMan guides the hero through three levels in which he is expected to save the Earth's dying fuel reserves and avoid excess plastic consumption and deforestation at the same time.
  
  The three levels take place in three different decades:
  
  Level 1- 1998 - Plastic use increases and Petrol reserves start dying. EarthMan needs to ensure the safety of the planet.
  
  Level 2- 2008 - The IT revolution creates considerable metal waste and it is upto EarthMan to avoid them.
  
  Level 3- 2018 - Apple introduces recyclable Aluminium which EarthMan needs to collect in order to ensure that the planet is not polluted by the industry.
  
Made with ❤️
